# Minimal-D-Separators-in-Linear-Time-Project

This project explores graphical causal models with a focus on d-separation and minimal d-separators in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and generalized graph structures. The notebook implements key algorithms, visualizes graphs, and tests the results against examples from the literature.

## Features

- **DAG Analysis**: Implements algorithms to calculate minimal d-separators for DAGs.
- **General Graph Analysis**: Extends functionality to mixed graphs (RCGs and AGs) using the `pywhy_graphs` library.
- **Visualization**: Provides graph plotting for clarity and validation of results.
- **Validation**: Includes tests to verify algorithm correctness, consistent with existing literature.
